### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

> As we can see with respect to current trends, the increase in population densities along with lack of space to ride personal vehicles, has led to a surge in ride sharing, vehicle renting and more importantly usage of vehicles that don't use the conventional fossil fuels. Bike sharing is one such area which is seeing some good growth in terms of usage and relevance. However riding a bike comes with its own share of problems especially related to weather. People tend not to ride a bike in rains than when it doesnt rain. Or if it is too hot and humid also office commuters might not opt for bikes. The idea behind analyzing the usage of bike sharing is to identify points in a year where the usage dipped compared to the highs or averages and then come up with concrete solutions to possible increase the usage of bikes during those times. 


### Section 2: Description of the data

Example:

> I will be visualizing the data of the bike sharing facility in London between 2015 and 2017. The data is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset).

> The data set has 10 columns that shows the relation between

* date 
* the number of bikes rented 
* temperature
* humidity
* wind-speed
* day of the week
* season
* weather

> The above parameters will help us understand , how the number of bikes rented varies as per the other variables. 


### Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

> Jonathan is a government official as part of the UK's ministry of clean energy. One of the scientific arms of the UK government have come up with a proposal to harvest energy from bikes that are rented on a daily basis. The idea is to build pathways that will generate minute forms of electrical energy based on contact with each contact of the bike tire. However in order to ensure considerable power is generated, the UK government has to make sure more people ride bikes under different conditions. We asked Jonathan, what are the key answers he wants to look at from the data, that will help him increase the number of people who ride bikes.

* How does the bike sharing facility in London vary in terms of months?

* Is there a consistency in terms of the number of bikes rented on an hourly basis all through out the year?

* How does the number of bikes rented vary as per the weather and seasons in a year?

> The answers to the above questions will help Jonathan decide where exactly the government needs to increase the count of rides and consequently identify the problems and come up with possible solutions to eliminate or decrease the proeblems.
> The dashboard will give Jonathan a chance to present his proposal to his superiors and give a clear idea as to what needs to be done.
