## About the App

The idea of creating the dashboard is to come up with points in a year where the bike sharing facility in London dropped and then come up with solutions to increase the usage at those points for multiple scientific uses such as generation of power etc. The data that is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset), gives us the data for two years of 2015 and 2016 for the number of bikes shared in the city of London.

The dashboard of the app has a side panel which offers to filter based on seasons and years.

Based on the filters selected the number of bikes shared can be visualized for each season in a year or weather or hour of the day.

The proposed visualization as shown in the draft below will help answers the questions in the proposal.
